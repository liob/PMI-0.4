The runtime versions of PMI are stored in a separate repository "PMI-0.4-runtime"

The PMI source code is poorly documented, but this will get you started:

1. To run PMI from the source code: open IDL, add the folder "/PMI-0.4" to your IDL path, then type "pmi" in the command line.

2. To create a runtime version of PMI: open IDL, type "pmi__compile" in the command line, and save in the folder "/PMI-0.4-runtime/PMI-0.4-Template"

3. To run the runtime version: double-click on the file "/PMI-0.4-Template/pmi.sav" (no need to open IDL first)

4. To run or compile PMI with a different menu (eg. "MyMenu"): open the file "/PMI-0.4/Skeleton/PMI__Menu" and replace "PMI__Menu__Skeleton" by "PMI__Menu__MyMenu"
